              For years, many students have faced a tough challenge: school fees
              holding them back from chasing their dreams. It's like a roadblock
              that's kept them from moving forward in their studies. 
              Recently, one of our coursemates, who despite being the brightest
              of the bunch,could not raise the fees in order to sit for the
              final exam.In the spirit of brotherhood, we, the fellow students,
              decided to raise money to cater for the fee deficit.
              <br />
              <br />
              This was achieved by the 100 bob challenge. By virtue of each of
              us contributing 100 shilings,the fee was cleared. Not everyone is
              as lucky to continuously afford tuition fees. As such,we want to
              change that story. We imagine a Kenya where these students can
              finally pursue their dreams without worrying about money. We're
              starting a special fund, and we need partners like you to help
              make this change happen. Your support can be the key that unlocks
              a brighter future for these students. Let's rewrite their story
              together, one filled with possibilities and success.
